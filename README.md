## Technical and Architectural Choices

- **React:** Chosen for its component-based architecture, making it easier to build and maintain the UI.
- **React Router:** For handling routing within the application, allowing for a single-page application (SPA) experience.
- **Styled-Components:** For styling the components, providing a scoped and modular CSS approach.
- **Jest:** For testing, chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration with React.
- **Webpack:** For bundling the application, providing a configurable build process.
- **Context API:** Used for state management to provide a simple and lightweight solution compared to more complex libraries like Redux.

## Improvements

- **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling to cover more edge cases and provide more informative error messages.
- **Accessibility:** Improve accessibility features throughout the application to ensure it is usable by everyone.
- **Testing:** Increase test coverage, including more integration and end-to-end tests.


## Additional Time Allocations

- **Design Enhancements:** Spend more time on improving the UI/UX design, including animations and responsive design adjustments.
